Score , Accepted 
30      0
85      1

Accepted : Dependdent Variable 

Linear Regression plot : In Linear Regression the line we plot is not helpful for predicting the dependent variable using the independent Variable

Classification of Logistic Regression : 
That is Class A  , Class B

Sigmoid Function :
Y = 1/1+e^(-x)
x is the independent variable 
e is the euler's constant = 2.718
Y is the output

Sigmoid Function is trying to cnvert the independent variable into a expression of probability that ranges between 0 And 1 with respect to the dependent variable
